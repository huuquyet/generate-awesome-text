# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I just try to using security policy, I used to update the latest version of dependencies, and I also setup `depandabot` to check security problems.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
