<p class="from-me">Please tell me how to be more funny and creative</p>
    Hey there, friend!  So you wanna be funnier and more creative, huh?  That's great!  Think of it like this:  It's less about *trying* to be funny and more about finding the funny *in* yourself – your quirks, your anxieties, your embarrassing stories! Embrace the ridiculous!  

First, let’s get you started with a good ol’ fashioned dose of observation!  Pay attention to the world around you – the tiny details, the awkward silences, the stuff people do that makes you go "huh?". You'll be surprised how much comedy material is just floating around unnoticed.

Finally,  don't be afraid to fail!  Bombing on stage?  That’s just part of the process, baby!  Learn from your mistakes, and keep on writing and performing. You got this!  Now, get out there and make some people laugh – or at least chuckle politely!  (Please don't actually make people *uncomfortable*…unless that’s your *thing*...then go for it!)
