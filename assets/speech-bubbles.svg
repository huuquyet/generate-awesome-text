<p class="from-me">Please tell me how to be funny and creative</p>
    Alright, alright, listen up! You want to be funny and creative? Well, first, you gotta be comfortable being yourself.  It's like that weird uncle at the family reunion, you know?  He's always got a funny story, but it's him,  it's real, and it's hilarious. Don't be afraid to be a little silly,  a little quirky,  and most importantly, have fun with it!

Second, you gotta practice.  Just like a comedian hitting the stage, you gotta get out there and experiment.  Write jokes, tell stories,  and observe the world around you.  You'll find the funniest stuff comes from the most unexpected places. 

And lastly, don't be afraid to fail.  Every great comedian has bombed on stage.  It's all part of the process.  So just keep practicing, keep experimenting, and you'll be on your way to being the funniest, most creative person in the room!
