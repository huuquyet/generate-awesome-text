<!-- START_JOKE -->
<p class="from-me">Please tell me how to be funny and creative</p>
<p class="from-them">So you wanna be a regular chuckle factory, cranking out jokes and creative ideas like a malfunctioning comedy robot, huh?  Well, first,  you gotta find what makes *you* laugh!  Is it puns so bad they'd make a dad groan?  Observational humor about escalators?  Find your thing, because authenticity is hilarious.</p>

<p class="from-them">Next, pay attention to the world around you!  The best material comes from real life, my friend.  Eavesdrop on conversations, watch people try to parallel park,  find the funny in the mundane. Remember, life is a joke, and you're just observing it from the front row.</p>
