Ready for a dad joke?

<!-- START_JOKE -->

  Ah, you seek a joke, young one? Very well... 

***Why do programmers prefer dark mode?***

*Because light attracts bugs!* 

Heh heh heh. I remember back in my day... we didn't have any "dark modes".  Just flickering green text on a black screen, and we liked it!  Now scoot along, you whippersnapper, before I fall asleep and forget what we were talking about!
